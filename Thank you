Hello,

I was surpised to see you following me. It's been many years since and, admittedly, not easy. I still remember sitting there when you appeared merely saying "What do you need?"

I don't know if you undertsand the rarity of what you did. Every 100 + people that passed by only 1 would stop, maybe giving a few coins or a dollar. 
You literally went into the store and got me everything I truly needed. I'm still not in the best situation, however, I can focus on coding for 6+ hours  a day now.
All the time since was filled with so many mishaps, adventures, horrors, despondency, travel and much more.
All of that time only reinforced the rarity of your random act of kindness. It's those few acts that allowed me to continue on.
Honestly, it's just not in my nature to be a bad person, although the opportunity was there a multitude of times(to advance myself on someones loss.)
There is a quote from a holocaust survivor:
"10% of the world is good, 10% is bad, the other 80% can swing either way."
I'm not sure how long until I will be able to get a job as a Back-End Developer, although I am grateful for the opportunity I have now to truly focus on learning/advancing.

Thank you, truly, for your random act of kindness.
